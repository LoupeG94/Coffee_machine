  <p>Building on the last challenge, write a program that asks the user how long, on average, they spend on a computer per day and:</p> 
  <p><strong><em>if</em></strong> it is less than 2 hours says ‘That seems reasonable’<br> <strong><em>else if</em></strong> it is less than 4 hours per day says ‘Do you have time for anything else?’<br> <strong><em>else</em></strong>, the programs says, ‘You need to get outside more!’</p> 
  <p>Remember: <strong><em>else if</em></strong> is shortened to <strong><em>elif</em></strong> in Python</p>
